```

---

## Phase 8: Troubleshooting Guide

### ❌ Problem 1: "fatal: not a git repository"

**Cause:** You're not in a git repository directory

**Solution:**
```bash
# Navigate to the correct directory
cd ~/gitlab_project/ci_cd/task_1

# Initialize if needed
git init
```

---

### ❌ Problem 2: "error: src refspec main does not match any"

**Cause:** Branch naming issue, or trying to push before creating commits

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check current branch
git branch

# If on master, rename to main
git branch -M main

# Make sure you have commits
git log

# Try pushing again
git push -u origin main
```

---

### ❌ Problem 3: "Permission denied (publickey)"

**Cause:** SSH key issues (if using SSH)

**Solution:** Use HTTPS instead
```bash
# Change remote from SSH to HTTPS
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/DevOps-Ostad.git

# Try pushing again
git push -u origin main
```

---

### ❌ Problem 4: "Authentication failed"

**Cause:** Wrong GitHub credentials or personal access token

**Solution:**
```bash
# For HTTPS, you need:
# - Username: Your GitHub username
# - Password: Your GitHub personal access token (NOT your password)

# Generate token: GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens

# Try push again
git push origin main
```

---

### ❌ Problem 5: "dev branch doesn't exist on GitHub"

**Cause:** Branch was created locally but not pushed

**Solution:**
```bash
# Make sure you're on dev branch
git checkout dev

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin dev

# Verify it's pushed
git branch -r
```

---

### ❌ Problem 6: "Merge conflict"

**Cause:** Changes conflict between branches

**Solution:**
```bash
# If merge conflicts occur, resolve them:
# 1. Open the conflicted file
nano hello.txt

# 2. Look for conflict markers: <<<<<<, ======, >>>>>>>

# 3. Edit to keep what you want
# 4. Remove conflict markers
# 5. Save and add
git add hello.txt
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflict"
```

---

### ❌ Problem 7: Pull Request shows "Can't merge - conflicts"

**Cause:** dev branch has conflicts with main

**Solution:**
1. Go to PR page
2. Click "Resolve conflicts" button
3. Edit the conflicted files
4. Mark as resolved
5. Commit the merge

OR resolve locally:
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout dev
git merge main
# Resolve conflicts
git add .
git commit -m "Merge main into dev"
git push origin dev
```

---

## FAQ

### Q1: What's the difference between git push and git push -u?

**A:** `-u` (upstream) sets up tracking. First push to new branch needs `-u`. Later pushes don't need it.
```bash
git push -u origin dev    # First push (sets upstream)
git push                  # Later pushes (automatically goes to origin/dev)
```

---

### Q2: What if I made changes on the wrong branch?

**A:** Use stash and switch:
```bash
git stash              # Save changes
git checkout dev       # Switch to correct branch
git stash pop         # Apply changes
git add .
git commit -m "message"
git push origin dev
```

---

### Q3: How do I delete a local branch?

**A:**
```bash
git branch -d dev         # Delete if merged
git branch -D dev         # Force delete if not merged
```

---

### Q4: How do I delete a remote branch?

**A:**
```bash
git push origin --delete dev
```

---

### Q5: Can I undo a merge?

**A:** Yes, if not yet pushed:
```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~1   # Undo last commit/merge
```

If already pushed to GitHub, create a new PR that reverts the merge.

---

### Q6: What if I committed on main by mistake?

**A:** Create a branch from that commit:
```bash
git branch dev              # Create dev from current main
git reset --hard HEAD~1     # Reset main to before commit
git push -f origin main     # Force push (careful!)
```

---

### Q7: How do I see what changed in a commit?

**A:**
```bash
git show COMMIT_ID         # Show specific commit
git diff main dev          # Compare two branches
git log -p                 # Show commits with changes
```

---

### Q8: What's a good commit message format?

**A:** Follow this format:
```
[Type]: [Brief description] (50 chars max)

[Detailed explanation if needed]

Examples:
- "Add hello.txt file in dev branch"
- "Fix typo in README.md"
- "Update configuration for production"
- "Remove deprecated function"
```
