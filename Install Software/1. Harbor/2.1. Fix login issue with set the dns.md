The SAN is **still not being added**. The issue is with how openssl is processing the config. Let me use a **different approach**:

---

## Step 1: Remove old certificates

```bash
cd /home/ashraful/software/data/cert
sudo rm -f harbor.key harbor.crt
```

---

## Step 2: Generate certificate with SAN using -addext

```bash
sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \
  -keyout harbor.key \
  -out harbor.crt \
  -subj "/C=BD/ST=Dhaka/L=Dhaka/O=MyCompany/CN=36.255.69.72" \
  -addext "subjectAltName=DNS:36.255.69.72,IP:36.255.69.72"
```

---

## Step 3: Verify SAN is Present

```bash
openssl x509 -in harbor.crt -text -noout | grep -A 2 "Subject Alternative Name"
```

Should now show:
```
X509v3 Subject Alternative Name: 
    DNS:36.255.69.72, IP:36.255.69.72
```

---

## Step 4: Set Permissions

```bash
sudo chmod 600 harbor.key
sudo chmod 644 harbor.crt
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /home/ashraful/software/data
```

---

## Step 5: Regenerate Harbor Config

```bash
cd ~/software/harbor
sudo ./prepare
```

---

## Step 6: Restart Harbor

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Wait 15 seconds for containers to start.

---

## Step 7: Verify Containers Running

```bash
docker-compose ps
```

All 9 containers should show **UP**.

---

## Step 8: Test Docker Login

```bash
docker login -u admin -p 786Shuvooo 36.255.69.72:4433
```

Should now succeed:
```
Login Succeeded
```

---

Try this and report back! Let me know if Step 3 shows the SAN this time. 🔐
